# Introduction

[Fyreactyl](https://github.com/FyreHub/Fyreactyl) is a open-source client area that allows users to view and manage their resources for their game servers. They can create as many servers as they are given from plans that are set, with custom RAM, Disk, CPU limits and other controls. The client area uses [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/), the client panel utilizes the API key from pterodactyl to create the servers and users.

Fyreactyl uses Discord Authentication, and email and password, the discord login allows you not to have to store passwords. It is also easy to use and very user friendly.

If you get any issues installing Fyreactyl, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3EfyVECKkg) and use one of the dedicated support channels to ask your question.
